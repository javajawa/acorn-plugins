Acorn PHP Framework
==================

Plugins for Acorn, a light PHP template, drawing ideas from the MVC pattern.

However, it makes use of a fourth kind of component - the Renderer - to break
up sections of view code, and to encourage the separation of logic, data, and
output.

The plug-ins are organised into broad categories to make it easier to find what
you need.

Using Plugins
-------------

Each plug-in file defines it's own namespace. They can be auto-loaded from a
project or shared directory using Acorns auto-loading system.

Is This Code Mature?
--------------------

Not Quite

Is That All?
------------

Yes. I'll finish the ReadMe once the code is mature.
